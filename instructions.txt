Hi Fran,

I noticed the workload was unbalanced, so I took care of the Telegraf configuration and the Flux Alert scripts, since I was already familiar with the data structure.

# What I have finished:
* Producers: 3 Python containers are configured to send data in "bursts" using InfluxDB Line Protocol.
* Broker: Kafka is configured on port 9092.
* Network: The `deep-space-net` is active.
* Telegraf Config: I have already configured `telegraf.conf` to bridge my Kafka topics to your InfluxDB.
* Flux Alerts: I wrote the 3 `.flux` scripts (`alert_mobility`, `alert_eclss`, `alert_hga`) and placed them in the `flux/` folder.

# What you need to do:
You just need to focus on the Database and the Dashboard Visualization.

* Update `compose.yaml`**
* Add the `mission-control-db` service (InfluxDB).
* Add the `telegraf-gateway` service (use the config file I provided).
* Networking: Connect Telegraf to BOTH networks (`deep-space-net` and `ground-control-net`). Connect InfluxDB ONLY to `ground-control-net`.

* The Dashboard:
Start the project (`docker compose up --build`). Go to InfluxDB (localhost:8086) and create the visual dashboard:
Gauge: For "cabin pressure" (from `eclss` measurement).
Heatmap: Map "rpm" vs "traction" (from `mobility` measurement).
Stat: Show max "radiation" (from `eclss`).
Graph: Plot "battery_voltage" with a static RED line (Threshold) at value 20.

* Register the Alerts
* Go to the "Tasks" or "Alerts" section in InfluxDB.
* Copy/Paste the code from the `.flux` files I sent you to register them in the system.
